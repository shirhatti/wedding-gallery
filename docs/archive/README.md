# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical planning documents and technical analyses that were created during development. These documents represent design explorations, optimization strategies, and implementation planning that may or may not have been fully implemented.

## Contents

### Optimization & Performance Analysis

- **[HLS_OPTIMIZATION.md](HLS_OPTIMIZATION.md)** - HLS architecture and TTFB optimization (✅ All optimizations implemented)
- **[OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS.md](OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS.md)** - Video signing performance optimization options (Partially implemented)

## Note on Relevancy

These documents were created during active development (circa October-November 2025) as planning and analysis artifacts. Some of the proposed optimizations and architectures may have been:

- **Implemented** - Features described may now be in production
- **Partially Implemented** - Some aspects adopted, others deferred
- **Not Implemented** - Ideas explored but not pursued
- **Superseded** - Replaced by alternative approaches

For current, authoritative documentation on the implemented system, see:

- [Architecture Overview](../architecture/overview.md) - Current system architecture
- [HLS Implementation](../architecture/hls-implementation.md) - Implemented video streaming
- [Pages Migration](../architecture/pages-migration.md) - Completed migration details

## When to Reference These Documents

These archived documents are useful for:

- Understanding historical design decisions
- Exploring optimization opportunities
- Learning about alternative approaches considered
- Planning future enhancements

They should **not** be used as:

- Current implementation documentation
- Operational runbooks
- Development setup guides

For current documentation, always refer to the main [documentation index](../README.md).
