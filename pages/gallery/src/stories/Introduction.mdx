# Wedding Gallery Storybook

Welcome to the Wedding Gallery component library! This Storybook contains interactive examples of all UI components used in the wedding gallery application.

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. It helps you:

- **Develop components in isolation** - Build components without worrying about the rest of the app
- **Test different states** - Visualize all possible states of a component
- **Document components** - Create living documentation with interactive examples
- **Speed up development** - Faster iteration on UI without running the full app

## Getting Started

### Running Storybook

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will start Storybook on http://localhost:6006

### Building Storybook

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

This creates a static build in the `storybook-static` directory.

## Component Library

Browse the components in the sidebar:

### UI Components
- **Button** - Various button styles and sizes
- **Badge** - Status badges and labels
- **Card** - Card containers for content
- **Dialog** - Modal dialogs and overlays

## Design System

This project uses:
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** as the component foundation
- **class-variance-authority** for variant management
- **Lucide React** for icons

## Dark Mode

All components are designed for dark mode by default, matching the wedding gallery aesthetic.

## Contributing

When adding new components:
1. Create the component in `src/components/`
2. Add a `.stories.tsx` file alongside it
3. Document all variants and use cases
4. Test in different states (disabled, loading, etc.)

Happy coding! 🎨
